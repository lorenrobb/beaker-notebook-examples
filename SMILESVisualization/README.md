# Visualization of SMILES notation for structure of chemical species
## Notebook uses d3 component for representation and pubchempy puthon library for SMILES parsing

##The simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) is a specification in form of a line notation for describing the structure of chemical species using short ASCII strings

## Important notes:
* Need to install pubchempy library (**pip install pubchempy**)
* Put the following files in **~/.beaker/v1/web/chemData** folder:

     - .csv file with periodic table data (pt-data.csv - can be downloaded from http://php.scripts.psu.edu/djh300/cmpsc221/p3s11-pt-data.htm)
