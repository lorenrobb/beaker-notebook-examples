# An Exploration of Citi Bike Riders in NYC

## This notebook provides an example of how to mine publicly available Citi bike data, using basic statistics to uncover interesting patterns. It uses Ipython as the language of choice (with pandas and numpy). There's also some Groovy at the end to show how data can be passed between languages.
